Information and navigation

- This network diagram shows the relationships between Scotland's AI Strategy and the various policies and strategies it references, based on the extent of 'relatedness' in terms of quantity of content discussing one or all of the themes of ethics, AI and mental health

- There are navigation buttons in the left bottom corner, which will allow you to move the diagram around the screen. Alternatively you can click the left mouse buttong and drag the diagram around the screen.

- The buttons in the bottom right of the screen will allow you to resize the diagram to fit your screen, and zoom in and out with the plus and minus buttons. You can also zoom in and out using the mouse wheel.

- Each of the coloured squares shows documents 'clustered' according to which of the themes they address, with the exception of the Life Science Strategy for Scotland, which only includes mental health and none of the other themes.

- Double-clicking with the left mouse button on one of the clusters will open that cluster and allow you to see the various policies and other documents linked to Scotland's AI Strategy. Clusters can be closed by double-clicking with the left mouse button on any of the cluster members.

- Within clusters, some squares will be bigger than others which indicates those documents have a greater quantity of content discussing particular themes. For example, within the 'Ethics & AI' cluster, the document 'How the EU can Achieve Legally Trustworthy AI' mentions ethics and AI more than the 'Infrastructure Investment Plan'.

- Below the navigation buttons in the bottom left corner, the 'Reinitialize clustering' button will close all clusters.

- To find out more about each of the linked policies, navigate to the Policy Reference Table tab at the top of the storyboard.
